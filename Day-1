OS- Interface between User and Hardware.
Cloud Computing- On demand delivery of IT resources over the internet; You can access technical resources such as storage, databases, compute, networking, security with pay as you go.
Cloud Providers in market- AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform(GCP). 
ec-elastic compute cloud

DevOps(Development and Operation)- SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle): It is a structured step by step process that development teams used to create high quality, cost effective and secure software.
*Set of practical and  principles and cultural philosophies that aim to bridge the gap between software development and operations.
Goal:   Shorten the software development life cycle,
	improve collaboration between development and operations team
	deliver high quality software faster and more efficiently.
Key points of DevOps:
1st: Automation
2nd: Continuous integration
3rd: Continuous Delivery/Deployment
4th: Contribution/Collaboration
5th: Monitoring

Why DevOps Matters?
It's a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier ,maintenance of existing deployments.
Benefits:
Speed, Rapid Delivery, Reliability, Improved Collaboration, Scale, Security.
How it Works?
Continuous Integration:


**************************************Waterfall:*****************************************
Distinct goal for each phase of development.
Requirements->Analysis->Design->Coding->Testing->Operations
Limitations:    
	High amounts of risk and uncertainty
	Once app is in testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was well thought out in the concept stage
	Not a good model for complex and Object Oriented projects
	No working project is produced until the last procedure	

***********************************Agile Methodology****************************************8*
DevOps is culture, fostering collaboration amongst all participants involved in the development and maintenance of software. 
Agile can be described as a development methodology designed to maintain productivity and drive release with the common reality of changing needs.	
Limitations:
	Developer: Code works in this laptop
	Operator: Some problem with the code, Doesn't work in production.

Server Components: -OS(Linux, Win, Mac), 
		   -RAM(16GB etc.), 
		   -ROM(HDD,SSD), 
		   -Networking.

Commands:

1. ls- is a command to list files and directories, means folders.
2. touch- is a command to create empty files. eg: touch manya
3. "cat > manya "- opens the file, ctrl C to go back from the file
4. cat manya- to display the content in the file manya.
5. rm - remove the file. eg: rm manya
6. mkdir- make directory
7. cd- change directory. eg: cd Dname(switch to directory)
			     cd .. - exit from the directory
8. To delete directory:
	With file: rm -r eg: rm -r directoryName
	Without file: rmdir (empty directory) eg: rmdir directoryName
9. ls -l: list of files and the directories with permissions.
10. pwd - print working directory/present
11. history- to check the history overall
12. cd ../.. : to exit from the directory directly to home

What is a server:
It is a powerful computer or a system that provides services or data to other computers now as clients.
Clients: Come over a internet.
Servers are designed to manage, store and process data and they play a critical role in handling request delivering responses within a network.

Types of Servers:
WebServer: Delivers web pages to user's browsers. eg: ngnx
FileServer: Stores and manages files that clients can access and share over a network.
DatabaseServer: Manage database and provide access to clients for reading, writing and updating data. eg: MySQL, MongoDB
MailServer: Handles the sending, receiving and storage of emails. eg: Microsoft exchange.

Server Components:
OS, RAM, CPU, Storage, Network Interface Call

EC2 Configurations:
1. Name of the Server
2. Application and OS images(Amazon Machine Image) 
	-os selection
3. Instance type: choose number of CPU's and RAM
4. Keypair: used to connect securely to instance
5. Networking:
	-firewalls
	-VPC: virtual Private Cloud
	-subnets
	-route labels
	-NAT
	-Internet gateway
	-Elastic IPS
6. Configure storage:
	-EBS(Elastic block store)
	-EBS nothing but similar to hard disk
	-Persistent block level storage
	-can create new volumes and attach to running
7. Launch instance:
	webserver/windows server

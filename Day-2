What is Horizontal and vertical scaling?
Vertical: increase the number of CPU s
Horizontal: automatically increase the number of servers

1. Load Balancer- To distribute the incoming application traffic to registered targets called servers
2. Autoscaling- Automatically add or remove servers based on traffic and defined policy
3. Cloud watch alarm- It will trigger the alarm when there is a problem in servers, whenever crossed the CPU utilization threshold
4. SNS- Simple Notification Service- Sends notification to the registered emails, sends notification

Create Topic in AWS:
1. Search in the bar SNS
2. Select SNS
3. Create topic
4. Select standard not fifo
5. Done
6. Add subscriptions
7. Select email or phone
8. Enter subscription
9. Confirm mail and then delete in topic and subscriptions

Create Instance
1. Near AWS logo, 9 dots logo
2. Then select compute
3. Select EC2 
4. Launch instances
5. Enter everything
6. Create instances

**************************************LOAD BALANCER**********************************************

Elastic Load Balancing:
- Automatically distributes traffic across multiple targets
- Provides high availability
- Incorporates security
- Perform Health checks

Types:
- Application Load Balancer HTTP and HTTPS:
- Network Load Balancer TCP and UDP
- Gateway Load Balancer IP

Load Balancer Components:
             Load Balancer
Listener 1                     Listener 2
Target 1 Target 2          Target 1 Target 2 Target 3
Target Group 1             Target Group 2
         
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling:
- Helps you control EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application.
- Launches or terminates your AWS resources based on specified conditions.
- Registers new instances with load  balancers, when specified.
